# AssociateCourseWork
Assignment submitted during my time pursuing my Associate's degree

This is some of my earliest work that is worth putting on the internet!
There is a clear progression in how I format my code and approach design throughout these assingments.

The primary goal of most of these assignments was to create and implement different data structures.
The work found in the 'Java II' folder is probably the oldest of the bunch. Primarily intro level assignments and rudimentary solutions to them.

All code is my own, unless otherwise stated!
