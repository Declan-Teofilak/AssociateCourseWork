# AssociateCourseWork
Assignment submitted during my time pursuing my Associate's degree

This is some of my earliest work that is worth putting on the internet!
There is a clear progression in how I format my code and approach design throughout these assingments.

The primary goal of most of these assignments was to create and implement different data structures.

All code is my own, unless otherwise stated!
